## Transcript

all right happy thursday it's a day earlier than usual but it's another episode of learning tech talks where we are continuing to explore the landscape of learning technology while cutting through the fluff and getting the questions answered you need answered and today we are talking about i don't know we've got a we've got a wild mix of stuff we've got we've got micro learning we've got frontline workers we've got what's going on on the on the great resignation space and i'm joined by tal and iran correct i said i get it right all right and they're from bites and and they're from bites and we're gonna get going on this and i'm actually while you're doing your introductions i'm gonna post on linkedin because the linkedin link broke but everything else was live so i'm gonna do that while you're doing it so while we're doing this we're gonna do the usual icebreaker games that we always do which is let's start with where are you in the world today mine's not nearly as exciting as anybody else's because i'm in wisconsin in the u.s with with my houseplant fred that's about it but how about the two of you where are you right now we're in tel aviv israel known as the startup nation you probably know that the startup nation yeah we are the start of nation

and it's like it and we talked about this before we went live it's like technically if you're in the states this would be like having a conversation with me on a friday evening which that's saying a lot to spend your friday evening hanging out with me i got to give you credit right there so all right and what's what's the weather like there because here it's starting to get cold so i am curious about that piece we're in the middle of a heatwave like always in israel uh our offices are right by the beach by the way it's evening right now but uh but the beach was full today it's about 28 degrees celsius okay like like it's like in the in the middle of the summer so middle of summer okay well well i asked the next question it's not supposed to be like this you know but well the weather is crazy oh it's not it's not supposed to be that hot right now it's november you know yeah it's supposed to be winter but you said it was what you said how what's the temp 32 celsius 28 28 28 all right all right all right i gotta look okay that's not too bad though so for for stateside folks 82 i mean that's warm i suppose november so is this technically your winter season though it's it's a bit sweet it's a bit different a little bit different okay yeah all right well that's not now if you told me it was if you told me it was you know 40 degrees celsius or something like that then i'd be like okay heat wave that's that's what we were dealing with west coast now for november it's not the evening okay all right that's fair that's fair

okay so let's let's go to question number two and you've had some time to think about this so i'm curious where you landed and i'll share mine i'll go second this time but in terms of preferred method of communication what is your preferred method of communication and i'm curious if this ends up tying to the topic at hand i didn't intentionally do that but we'll see what happens with it here that it has a strong connection i i figured it might i figured it might you're a guy so my my a preferred communication channel is instant messaging i'm addicted to instant messaging it actually changed my life it's simple it's fast and as i said you didn't mean it but it has a very strong connection to our solution okay all right so are there particular instant messaging pla because that's big instant messaging i mean that could be you need to be all sorts of things in israel we use whatsapp uh but you know there are lots of instant messaging channels around the world like all right we chat for example so big big asia pacific i remember when i was at ge doing a lot of stuff globally and wechat there were certain regions if you didn't have it in wechat just you might as well just not do it at all exactly specifically in china but in israel and pretty much everywhere in europe whatsapp is the number one uh messaging app

um all right all right next message so that that was only one of you answering i didn't get an answer on both sides so is it both just whatsapp we're waiting for uh for me yeah what's up as well don't call me please uh i don't know like like start people were starting to call me it's like being rude why are you calling me without asking before but if it's something long then definitely video uh short videos but if it's something short definitely what's up instant messaging okay all right all right so do you ever do you ever just well so i'm i'm gonna say mine is again well and this is actually gonna tie very closely to the conversation at hand which like i said that wasn't the plan but hey it works out because i would say similar to me if you call my phone i'm not gonna answer it like i'm not gonna i could see who it is and go i know this person and i would go if it's important you'll text me or you'll send me a message or something like that so i do think but this is a generational thing that now i hate stereotypes i hate you know generational stereotypes but i will say it does seem more common now that folks you know for me email instant messaging if you need something instant um i'm super introverted believe it or not and so for me the pic picking up the phone and talking to someone live unexpectedly not a fan or somewhere in person somebody just walking up and being like hi i did not plan for this i'm not ready for this

it was completely different 10 years ago but now it's like when someone calls you're being rude you didn't ask me for if you can call you know it it is really an interesting trend in that sense now there are some people i know that they will only call my dad being one of them like he's one like i'm like dad i'm never gonna answer the even if i'm not doing anything and the phone rings and i see it i'm still not gonna pick it up but for him he's still there so this is actually going to be a really interesting conversation to connect with this he didn't send i hope he didn't send him the link for this interview well he knows what's going on and he would be like yeah you know he's 100 right because he's told me this a million times but so let's talk about this because we're going to get into this topic of how do people actually communicate and connect with one another and how is that changing the way communications and learning and development is actually changing because this does have big implications on that but before we get into it it does make sense to talk about okay what's what's the two of your background and and how did you know at one point you know we're going to create a frontline video communication micro learning platform or where did that come from

wanting to start yeah okay um so first of all just you know to to say that bytes is a platform for training and ongoing professional communication inside organizations this is what we do and that is the what yeah yeah this is what this is the what i'll tell you a bit about our background and then we will be happy to start and you know show you the product and how it works um so actually we are three co-founders it's myself and we have lots of experience in three different pillars and topics first of all it's training and educating people then in tech and we also managed lots of people during our professional years and um if i'll tell a bit about me and hagai so i headed one of the one of the sat department in one of the biggest prep schools in israel and we quality in israel a psychometric test in united states you call the specific test s.a.t and yeah you know the test so i remember i remember preparing for it back in the day when it was like the big deal you had to take one of your best experiences oh yeah it was a great experience i always think back fondly on that and go i wish i could do that again yeah so you can but um so i headed a this division was a team leader there and we developed lots of professional content for our students but not only for our students for our employees as well they were gen z uh students and employees obviously they are the current workforce today's workforce and this is our background and we developed mainly digital content and we were we we tried to figure out how to create content in a fast way simple way and that it would be very engaging for them this was our goal

iran i will tell about iran because he's very modest most of the time so i will tell about him and it is a great entrepreneur he built lots of businesses from bars and restaurants to real estate company and he was responsible for training and engaging his employees to a professional content so we all come from this area of training of a teaching of managing businesses and employees and i think that at some point uh each of us we we actually recognize that there is a huge pain and a huge gap a in terms of quantity and being able to reach out to those frontline employees to these i would say especially in front lines yeah i would say there was a huge gap there that's right uh but the gap and the pain is for the people that actually need to create the content and then there is a huge plan in being able to create this engagement with the front-end employees we recognize the pain and we decided to to investigate it this pain and what we understood is that there are lots lots lots of solutions we knew them we actually used them but when we do our research we we understood that there are more of them a lot of solutions for content creation for employee engagement everyone talks about gen z about simple content creation about being able to consume the content anywhere anytime etc so yeah it's all the jargon it's it is there's tons of it out there yeah exactly and we all know to talk the talk uh but what we thought that most of us i'll say us but most of us actually don't walk the walk and we decided to take it and step ahead and we think that we actually figure out how to how to do it and we decided to uh to create bytes

and this so do either of you have a background in tech or either of you like software oh and i know you said there's a third co-founder so yeah where were any of you developers and you went you know what i think we can build something better that takes the good of what we've seen but actually improves on it by fixing some of the opportunities so you you can you can uh yeah but none of our us came from tech to this all right the guy is a tech guy he also was sat instructor and as tal said uh i was very close to the frontline employees i at some point i owned eight bars and restaurants here in tel aviv uh so we were all very tired again and you said real estate too right real estate and restaurants yeah we were talking about the kids in our prep call uh once the first kid was born uh my wife told me enough with the bars and restaurants uh so i went i went to the uh yeah um the schedule the the restaurant lifestyle is not necessarily super conducive to kids so that was probably that was probably a wise move yeah definitely she is wise okay i hope she's not listening here i hope she died but anyways uh the training of frontline employees always stays close to my heart it's a challenge that you know um everyone faces in this in the food and beverage industry in retail industry consumer goods and so on and i guess we'll talk about it in a second um

yeah so the three of you got together and said i think we can we can build something different and and then we started we started the bootstrap with a prototype and then we reached dozens of clients and users and then we decided that it's time to scale and recently we raised arc funds and now we're scaling we are we have 1400 a customers all around the world we have more than 200 000 users all around the world and how how long ago did you start this almost three years ago three years that's it yeah wow okay because all right that was being modest a little bit but we we've developed an mvp that accidentally succeeded it was just supposed to be a proof of concept uh but in general to be uh better than we thought even though it was uh patch by patch in the beginning um just a few web pages tied to each other but the essence of it was was the right thing and with this we started working both with small medium businesses and enterprises um you know it really scaled from then from there

so let's let's talk because we're we're 15 minutes in and there might be people who watch or listen now then they go i i told you this time's gonna go fast i'm telling you so so i gotta say this though because there's gonna be folks that go okay training communication platform again i i talk about this all the time and i spend i don't know how much time in the vendor space there's a lot of noise around okay training communication i i kind of get it but what specifically so let's talk a little bit about and and we'll show it as well but i'd also just like to talk about when we talk about reaching front lines with training and communication what were some of those gaps that you said hey i mean there's there's some stuff that's out there but it's not necessarily working as what we think is the best way possible what were some of those things that jumped out

right so essentially our solution is is very simple in in the front uh a lot of technology behind it obviously but a lot of the solutions uh they see ellen deal they're in development area it's different from communication and we so we see it as a whole so we've developed a solution that is very simple again it's based on three pillars three main pillars the first one would be a content creation app that only the content creators in the organization need to install this app uh where they can create a professional content or semi-professional content as easily as intuitively as they would create a story exactly like you would create a story for your tik tok instagram short youtube shorts this is the way you create professional content obviously with the necessary adjustment to to become professional but the essence is exactly the same once this content is being uh created it's being wrapped in a capsule which we call the bite each bite has the same structure this snake well i said i said i call these things stackables okay okay we will steal it from you that's you know what i i accept that's mine it's documented live now i know i said it live so i can't come back on it now yeah

so once this byte is being created very easily again and very fast most of the time in our content creation app it's been then being delivered to the frontline employees via instant messaging and we are completely agnostic to which channel you share it with it can be text message whatsapp line widget viber microsoft teams slack pretty much you name it you we integrate with it and you can send it via your existing instant messaging channels in that way that even organizations that are globally spread in one click of a button they send it to six or seven different platforms whether it's in china it's wechat in japan it's lining okay what's up united states texas so instead of trying to get people to be like okay what's the one place they are and let's try and get everybody on it it's you actually can hit multiple and go well it doesn't really matter which which matters on a global level because i've i've been in organizations where you're trying to get everyone on the same app i mean it's a struggle they it doesn't it's a struggle it doesn't work like you could i mean you can set out to do it but it doesn't work

it's first of all in global organization that's a huge pain but not always global not only on global organization even local organization it does there's a complete different conception behind it that we believe in it's not trying to bring employees front-line workers to your ecosystem it's reaching them in the place they're most attentive to in the place they consume most of their data you your your ice breaker question was what what preferred communication channel so i know that i live in my whatsapp right every message i get to my whatsapp i will see it if it's in some app in my second or third page there's i'll check no way and it won't be updated and even if i see it it will be every two or three weeks so that's the second pillar reach the employees in the place they're most attentive to and the place there already are

the third one would be monitoring tracking because even though it's it's a story based in its storyline content and even though it's shared through instant messaging in the end of the day it's professional content and you need you need to make sure that everybody saw this content they understood it if they had anything to comment on it or ask question so we also allow and we'll see it in a second a two-way uh uh street where people can comment ask questions and be engaged with your c-suite or you with your lnd instructors and with everyone so that's basic and that's the essence of bytes

so let me let me reframe it again just to kind of play it back to make sure i'm because you you've i've seen it i've i've seen it in action briefly before we went live here but so there's really three components of it because i think this is important so the creation and just to clarify so for the creator piece and one of the things you hit on man we we could easily talk about this for several hours but we're not going to so i'm going to try and move it move it quickly but the the only time someone has to necessarily download an app is if they're a creator is that correct exactly okay okay so free but now anybody technically can be a creator is that is that fair okay and that's part of the goal is to try and get more people to be creators creating content decide it's for the company to decide we believe that the company should encourage more and more people to be content creators it will be to to create you know some kind of community of creators yes by the company

okay so let's talk about i see i i'm telling you we're going to go in a lot of different directions here because this is an important discussion because this whole there's a there's been a recent trend and and people are talking about user-generated content becoming the thing and i would say even in the space a lot of people are still kind of like well what what does that mean and and how are we thinking about that because to your point you could mean well let's just let everybody create content which er you know everybody not everybody wants to and nor should they but on the other side you also i've seen the tendency to go the other way where companies lock this thing down and say we're only going to have five people in the entire company create any and you miss out so i'm curious when you work with organizations how do you how have you helped them navigate that because that's a really important piece because if you don't have enough content creators you don't have enough content to really keep it feeling fresh and live and actually addressing the problems you have too many it can get messy you can overwhelm an organization trying to roll it out so how do you help people find that balance

you want to go or should i so i can start and you can complete me like always um so look it's it's an evolution inside organization okay we start they start with a few content creators but then we buy it and we will show you i don't know one or two bytes and the bytes is very viral people love the bytes and when they see their colleagues actually producing a bite and when they see that they created a byte and auto and the and this byte is spread all over the company and everyone consumed the byte etc so they want to become creators so they come to their manager and they want ah maybe i can create about about this or about that so it's it it is a very natural process and you know if to if to emphasize something about this generation or today's workforce so they are all instant and story like oriented they all most of them create content and we spoke and earlier we spoke that just the three of us what is to create content um the question the question was if to create story on instagram it's to create content so my answer is yes it's definitely to create content so almost uh most of the people today create content on social media and some in some degree of but even even if they don't create content they all consume content and it is not just they consume content they addicted to this content yeah this is true when you wake up in the morning i i don't know maybe i i don't know if i should say oh he has too many kids i have too many that's true when i wake up in the morning so the first thing i do is open my instagram account and i'm sure that i am not the one only one so we try to create this kind of natural process inside the organization okay

if i may i just wanna yeah i just wanna emphasize a couple of things first of all there's a difference between creating and sharing uh we don't want the users to spam each other right so it doesn't mean that everyone who creates the content can share it right yes need it needs to have he or she needs to have the necessary level of permission well that's what i was going to ask in terms of the governance behind this because this is where sometimes people freak out about user-generated content is this fear of oh my goodness we're going to create a bunch of stuff and it's just going to get pushed out to the organization and it's like well no not necessarily and and you have to help organizations so don't worry about this no worries about this uh we won't every we won't let everyone uh on his first try or her first try to create something and you know spam the entire company that's not the way it works but definitely you as a bartender or a waitress or a retail associate you can definitely create a content offer to your management or your supervisors and they can decide whether to share it or not and okay so you produce the content bite the snackable whatever you're producing it and then as part of the workflow it's going to someone somewhere that then is being kind of thumbed up or thumbed down somebody's playing gladiator you know kind of doing this whole action and deciding what happened yeah exactly exactly like this uh it's up for the organization to decide who they want to authorize to share and who is not authorized to share but that's spamming is is something that obviously it's not it doesn't happen a lot and actually the best bites and the best content that we ever see is being generated by uh the floor workers the the you know the frontline workers and the frontline workforce but it has to be monitored obviously

well and i think on that piece especially so these are these areas where i go well this is true for frontline workers but it's actually also true for for even office workers because the reality is i think this is one of the gaps and this is why i do get excited about user generated content is you know a lot of times l d or or whoever comes they're tasked with creating this stuff and they're seven steps disconnected from what's actually happening so either one one of two things tends to happen you either have way too much bureaucracy in the process and by the time you actually create something so much time has passed its relevancy is gone it's like oh this just happened we should really let people know and in nine weeks we'll have actually gotten to it and pushed it out to the organization well now you've missed that window of opportunity on the other hand it also can lead to well to try and speed things up let's operate off our own assumptions which that's another dangerous territory to go oh yeah i bet this is what it's like on the floor and then they get it and go i mean this isn't anything like what we actually deal with and that's where i think user generated content can play a really critical role in saying well let the people who know what's going on tell us how to do it help us and and not be afraid of that

definitely definitely and this is most organizations said they start small they start with a small amount of creators but very fast they they spot the the good creators or they pop up by themselves who wants to create more bites uh it can be someone who is very passionate about creating content or it can be someone that is working for a long time and knows all the best practices uh and it can be pretty much on anything you know from how to fold the t-shirt or all the way how to deal with unsatisfied customer or how to take a coffee test okay okay you know it's fine oh go i'll just say something about um the need that information will actually to reach um to actually deliver information very fast to the floor yeah and you know when covid went into the world and it was march 2020 i i we have a very meaningful use case uh very meaningful is for us because you know everyone was terrified people governments and there was a sense of urgency to deliver information and to organize systems and try you know to stop and handle the pandemic and a government agency a approach to us and 48 hours later they had a few few play a few playlists of information they share the information with their teams with their staff with people all around the country uh and it was i think it was a very good example for first of all that it is so important to be able to create content fast and to deliver it fast sometimes you know it's a matter of life and death but sometimes the new product that you want to sell more um and i think that the bytes one of our main um values is is that we are plugging a plug-and-play solution so you can decide to start working with us create content and a few hours later all your actually push it out move it that quick exactly okay you just need to create stories like 10 minutes from now you can send a bite about pretty much everything to all of your employees worldwide uh and dallas mentioned that we have very very very high engagement levels so in a couple of hours over more than 90 percent of your workforce will probably probably see this bike would consume it wouldn't understand it yeah

well and you know it's it's interesting you bring up the speed of information being so critical for organizations and i think what happened in the last 18 months really highlighted how how ineffectively we've been doing this over the years i think we took for granted a lot of things where we went oh yeah no we're like we have email distribution lists when something happens we push out an email and everybody and everybody gets it and that counts and all of a sudden we hit the covet era where it was i mean i i've worked with a lot of companies that they had and this is where i think the front line really does make a difference big time because there the speed of information can be in some situations life or death you know and covet really highlighted that where hey this new protocol we need to implement this now not not two weeks from now not when you get around to checking your email or when you finally log into the internet to see the update like right this second we need this to hit you so that you know what to do and i think many organizations took for granted that they didn't really have a lot of good ways to be able to reach the workforce that quickly so i can imagine that that was you saw some explosion in growth as organizations realized oh oh no

definitely not just you know emails is one example but also people were able organizations were able to to get 30 new employees in a classroom and train them together in a day or two i won't talk about how effective it is and how how much of this they remember after a couple weeks but no even this was not wasn't possible anymore you couldn't get 30 people in the same classroom and you still can't in most places and norway you shouldn't then when i'm with you i'm with you on that one yeah yeah yeah and if you die if you want to do it on on a video conference or zoom yeah they're not going to fall asleep well yeah so that's so there there's a there's a whole another episode that we could talk about with this um

so i am curious that this and then i actually the next step would be i'd love to kind of talk because we'll we're focused on the creation piece i've got one more question and kind of area i want to dig into and then we can talk about the actual engagement which then i think it might make sense to show how people actually do this but you talked about the app then allowing creators and making it easy for them and i think this is a really really important point because a lot of people will say oh it's it's it's just too hard to get people to generate content and i would say tick-tock instagram i mean some of these social medias prove that it's like that's actually not true the challenge was removing the barriers that people had to figuring out how to do it i mean i just remember days of yore where it was well we should do a user generated content and everybody has a phone so they can just make content and you're like okay but operationally we're going to ask them to record a video and then and then they got to load it on a sharepoint drive and then they've got to you know move it for and and the complexity of it led to people just going you know what forget it i'm not doing this type of a thing so i am curious how you're you're helping solve for that because again if you make content generation easy not that everyone will just start generating content you got to be careful there but it does remove the barrier to entry so i'm curious what were some of the things that you've done to address that to make it easier for for users to say hey you know i can generate content this isn't that hard

cool so you're absolutely right about the evolution of technology and that there were barriers in the past and unfortunately the technology is much more advanced right now so uh first of all we've developed a flow that everyone goes through and we found it the same flow for everyone who creates the content uh to be the most effective and most engaging in in the point of view of the employee but not only that that really eases the pain of creating content because you don't need to start from a blank page you don't need to start from scratch and have a writer's block we we take you through a journey of of what to talk about we can give you inspirational bites or templates or uh even you know just the flow of of the bike itself that puts you in a structure when where it helps you uh uh really create a content fast the second thing is the technology we have a very advanced video editor uh which allows you uh to create a content easily you can take pretty much like tick tock but again with the focus of more professional uh world uh but you can take different video parts different media parts and combine them together you can add soundtracks auto captioning and and even i don't know highlight certain things so the entire creation process is very easy very intuitive um and you're absolutely right about the fact that not everyone is fit to be a content creator but every organization has quite a few so yes part of the implementation is spotting these people letting them the ability giving them the the ability to use our app and you'll find them uh alone uh so that's that's how we've built the our app with the mind of helping you create a content in a certain structure that both will keep your employees engaged and the content effective

okay okay well and i think you know talk talking about that piece this video the video creation piece and and mayo we'll have to we'll talk backstage afterwards because i'd love to just mess around with it and and you know give it give it a test drive because that is a big piece and and to me i would say tick tock and instagram are the two that jump to mind that really helped people see hey this this can be really easy and fun and content creation i think maybe we've seen an evolution over the past few years where people had this perception of what content was and had this very stuffy boring you know oh we're gonna have i mean i just even remember when i first started learning tech talks people thought it was gonna be this boring product demo with every new vendor going and i'm like what are you talking about that's not what content has to be so i can see helping people make that something that they can do easily would would make a big difference in that sense and is it primarily video yes so it's it's it's video but just to emphasize another angle there is a point where companies approach to external external suppliers that will create content for them most of the most of the times it's when they want to make a real digital content which will be interactive uh to create any kind of collaboration between people and being able to monitor track manage the content because everyone in the organization can create a short video or create a powerpoint presentation but this is not the way to conduct you know a a team or professional content so what we did is we gave them the option to create this short tick tock profession to create this short tick tock we call him the we call it the professional story the bike is actually the professional story and it is professional because we we actually enable them in minutes to add interactive elements uh operation and of course the option to monitor it and it's you know if you you know what you want if you know what you want to say you just shoot a video and in a two more minutes you add this interactive and uh uh if you want to add a chat we will we will show you the bite yeah it's like a magic yeah you know like magic i like it yeah i love i love our solution you can recognize that we're very passionate yeah i'm very but if it's okay you were spot on some some organizations create bites uh you know they put a professional videos that they did a few years ago very professional very edited and we found out that the best performing bytes are not the the highly uh professional videos they're highly edited the rough videos the more tick tock like the more youtube like the more the more real the videos are the more real the bytes are this is how employees engage because i know personally when i open a video even on youtube or on bytes or tiktok and i see something highly edited something very professional you know all right it's a promotion bye-bye it's a commercial yeah when you could tell somebody's reading a teleprompter where you're just like all blame but i can see the the head chef talking to the to the camera and saying hi guys this is our new special dish for today then you got me i'm hoping i want to hear about it

yeah the thing about that is and and i almost feel like this accelerated my my observation has been that's that's probably always been the case that's just been my observation is people tend to engage with authenticity far more than other things but i think that's only accelerated over the past you know couple years because people have felt more disconnected from others they felt more disconnected they felt more distant and so being able to actually feel connected to what that content is as though that individual on the other side is is talking to you just having a conversation with you and telling you like you said i'm the head chef let me show you how to actually make this versus all right i'm going to pull up the recipe and you're like yeah i want to feel like i'm part of this i think you're right and there is additional thing that people use to to worry a lot about how they're being what's the perception about them right how it's been presented oh it's not highly professional it's not professional enough and today it's okay because of tiktok because of instagram because of youtube shorts uh people understand that the authenticity is more important than how i look right now how do i look on the camera right now i don't know perhaps i didn't cut my hair today but it's okay because this is who i am i don't have hair

no i i would say that that has been so so two things and then i actually want to i want to dig into it a little bit more that i think is an important piece in this and this would just be to anybody who's thinking about user generated content or if you're somebody who's thinking about creating content is there there were and historically have been a lot of barriers to it where people have felt they had to be something they're not or i've got to go you know make sure that my background is arranged perfectly and it's like no because that's not why people are engaging in the content they're engaging to hear what you have to say or what contribution you're making type of a thing versus you know well is that a is that a whatever kind of plant in christopher's bat like nobody cares nobody knows i've moved this plant intentionally i have three plants in my office i've moved it to see if anybody ever notices nobody ever notices nobody ever notices they don't care that there's a plant behind me but the other piece with the tech that you talked about that is important is there's a lot of folks who may still think a lot of these barriers exist to creating content and to me that's one of the exciting parts about technology like bytes and and just tick-tock instagram type things is producing content is easier and i think a lot of people are still holding onto this mindset that oh this is tough or we've got there's a lot that has to be done we don't have the technology to do this and it's like well actually we do it's it's pretty readily available now just pick up your camera pick up your phone film yourself say what you want to say really want to say don't use any special props don't use any special i don't know uh um editing capabilities just simply tell your employees what you want to say to them and they'll understand better i i i can guarantee and then better than 99 of other things

but well and to your point with that the video is by itself doesn't stand alone right it has to be in an ecosystem uh that does the entire learning cycle in the right way it needs to be as you will see followed by a question to make sure the employee so let's go to that let's go to that let's talk about the experience because see look at that look what we did right there we just tran transition naturally into that because i think this does the thing about it is not only with this and as you're pulling it up it's it's about being able to do that but by moving quick creating fast raw content like that you can hit you know sometimes you think about people spend weeks preparing one email hoping it goes out and like is perfect like you could have produced 10 little microbites of information that would have had a way better chance of making a difference than this one beautifully crafted you hired a copywriter to write it and make sure the graphic is exactly right type of a thing yeah and not to talk about today's workforce especially the the young generation they don't they they never check their emails right some of them don't even have an email but the ones who does they they never check it

so let's pull it up because now we're talking about go for it yeah i think just you know just to say that i think that you can't fake it uh and what i mean by that is if you don't create a platform that this is its dna so it won't work i mean that if you will add a feature you know some kind of video feature to an old-school concept it won't work if you want developed your concept to be mobile first so it won't be mobile first if you want to be focused on the content creation so people won't create content um so you can't fake it here there are places where you can fake it but not here no no so let's pull it up but i think your point out is really important because what you're talking about i i've seen a lot in learning and development where we try and take something we used to do that might have worked okay over here and then we just try and copy and paste it in a completely different way and it doesn't work to your point of not be you can't take something that was this way angle ah let's just try and like dump this in instagram no okay

okay so let's talk about deployment because so we talked about the back end these creators create this content the gladiator decides you know live or die is this thing going to go and then we're pushing it out and reaching people where they are regardless of whatever instant messaging platform they're on yeah so um again as we said as you just said it's whatever platform they're on right uh due to the limitation of this broadcast i can't share my mobile phone so i'll show it on a desktop version but estar said 99 of our users are on mobile and it's best played on mobile uh but i'll try to present i'll put on my whatsapp but again uh you can do it in text messaging and you're not sharing so when you pull it up i'll watch to see when it comes through but yeah so so while you're doing it on desktop most people are doing it for mobile from whatever 99 points whatsapp i don't know definitely we have deep integration with a lot of platforms like microsoft teams that you just mentioned uh but not only um and again what we're showing right now is the point of view of the employee the content creator technically you're not showing anything right now just inside so i'll minor minor detail yeah okay okay so that's your whatsapp which which you've already told me for both of you is it's where you live and what's up yeah

so the employee he or she will receive a byte uh instantness messaging instant message to their whatsapp group or at microsoft teams or whatever as we saw before and all they need to do is press a link all right there's one time login with your probably with your mobile number and once they've logged in that's it they're into the in the bite uh can you see my screen right now yep i can't so we're watching the pineapple we're watching the pineapple video yeah so this is one of our customers who was kind enough to to allow us to share it um and he wanted to train all of his employees worldwide how to cut the pineapple in the same way so it will be displayed in the same way so he created a bike with um with this video but what we see here is about that every bite has the same structure it has the story the professional story we talked about it in language it has the question the summary and the discussion these four parts are extremely important and that's the full learning cycle you deliver the content you make sure the employee got it you summarize and then you let them uh let their voice be heard so um in this case today we're going to learn how to turn this beautiful pineapple into this hopefully you can hear me at the same time yeah i can still hear it it's very much tick-tock-like it's a 38 seconds video uh i will let you play and shut up in a second so so as they're doing this this is where they're using the they're using the video editor that you're talking about where they they shoot the video that's why you're getting the sparkles and the the emojis popping up type stuff yeah i muted the volume so we can talk but everything you can you see here was created in our platform all right both the the sparkling and the editing and the voice over and everything is done in our platform uh it's you know this is someone who really likes tik tok style videos uh but you can i'll show in a second different types media and then it's followed by a question uh just to make sure the employees engage some sort of reinforcement yeah exactly reinforcement and then summarize with the power reminders what i want the employee to remember from this uh bite is to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds to soak the pineapple for one to two minutes and to slice the pineapple vertically and horizontally so that's pretty much so there's the bite that says like here's the again 30 second summary like this is the whole thing then you're saying hey here's the key point i want to make sure you got the question like you remembered how long are you supposed to so because because this is the key takeaway and then there's kind of the here's the reader's digest version of what you want watched just to make sure you you caught the key points yeah definitely

so what we showed is relatively simple example i i like it very much i think it's it's very effective and i think it's something that uh well we saw the results that everybody got uh uh very good everybody's pineapple looked exactly the same after they went through the bite yeah exactly and you can see the fourth part of the discussion right now it's in our demo environment so uh but you can see that everybody can says love it it looks so easy uh useful tutorial and you can reply as a manager uh and open a thread if someone doesn't understand anything you can uh open a thread instantly here exactly like you would comment on tiktok instagram or facebook and open a discussion so this messaging thread just going back to because they're starting workflow wise they're all starting in like is in your example they're starting in whatsapp yeah is it then taking them to an app or is it taking them to their browser no all the time it depends on the platform they're being sent the the buy to but if we have a deep integration with this platform it will everything will happen inside the the platform itself oh so if there's a deep integration it's not even bouncing you to anything else this is all just happening directly in teams yeah exactly in microsoft teams for instance like you said right now we have very deep integration uh with them so everything happens within the bytes within the team's app so you don't have to bounce out to the web with platforms that we have less of integration with or uh uh not such a deep integration then you're being redirected to the web but in no point you have to open an app the employee doesn't have to open an app okay or to install anything

and that's pretty much it so essentially that's that's a bite all right you got a 30 seconds video a 90 seconds video a 60 minutes video you answer one question you summarize with a power reminder and you let employees voice be heard uh it's like the first and the social element again just kind of unpacking some of this stuff because this is important again the structure regardless of how you're thinking about it if you're thinking about this kind of micro content because i think this is one of the things that as as you shared with me how you're doing this sometimes you have folks that they create this content it just goes out and you're like well but but did anybody get anything from it or is there any sort of you know connection do we have a feedback loop built in to know whether people found value in this was there something else so not only is it the content piece but that social element is actually creating a lot of this other element which is an important consideration for any sort of initiative because this is how you're going to filter out who are your really good content creators and what is the really meaningful content versus you're gonna get garbage content created i mean it's gonna happen it's not like it's you're immune from it

it's true we're not immune but that's what we said uh that sharing has to be uh in a certain way not everyone can share uh you know garbage content uh i do agree that sometimes people create less engaging content and less effective content sometimes it could be too long one of our customers even i don't know produced a six minutes video there's no technical limit here uh we don't recommend that we recommend it to slice it into a few bytes and create a playlist for it from it uh but there you have a lot of analytics around it we don't have time to show the dashboard and everything but you have tons of analytics who watch the video how many churn how many answer the question right who commented and what are what's the sentiment of the comments and a lot okay as an admin you can close the loop manage your employees manage the content um and of course you know the comments are very helpful for the content creator okay

there's one other thing about the comments which is more than just social uh listening or social gathering uh it's pretty much the only option for managers to hear the voice of their frontline plays who are geographically spread worldwide and we saw a lot of uh uh examples where the frontline employees said well that's not the way it works uh you really should think about this and this and this and the manager listened and they created the byte uh exactly on what they were asking whether it's the refund regulations or whether it's a new process so people are using this as a follow-up so they may see a comment and they say hey this is in like do you have more details on this and then the feedback loop goes back to the creator who says hey you know this was great to see as an example how to cut the pineapple but somebody might go i'm actually having a hard time with i have no idea the mango it's tight okay it's a two-way street it's exactly like i said it's a dialogue it can be uh please send me another example about this and that or uh i'm sorry i didn't understand this and that can you please you know elaborate about it

so um that's it and just the last thing i want to say is once the bite is finished every employee has their own personal knowledge feed every bite that i've ever received is being assigned to me where i can later on see it again i can reshare it i can uh refresh my memory and definitely search and whether it's i don't know how to welcome the customer how to sell a cake or how to cut a pineapple or even one of our customers did a yoga teacher training so that's that's pretty much got it got it so well and i think this is an important piece to consider because one of the things that's been interesting in the space i'm in and just spending so much time around it is a lot of folks in learning are looking for this like the the one way to do it and i'm like well there's not i mean you gotta think diversely about how you're approaching it but this component of real time quick bite size like hey i just need to help people know how to do something and i need to get the message out there fast and this goes back to an earlier point uh to how you made which is i've seen organizations and this is who know we're gonna not have time to unpack this whole thing but i i want to dig into it a little bit is that some organizations have fought hard to separate training from communications right like they're two different things no no we're training we don't deal with that no we're coms we and really sometimes the lines are so blurred that it's like why are we fighting over this versus just creating a solution and saying let's just get it out to folks

exactly i think that we don't see the bites as is you know as a feature for ongoing a a pro ongoing updates it's not it's not that the bytes can actually train people can can we train doctors via via the bytes for example we trained uh epidemiological investigators via the bytes so it's not it is not just for ongoing uh very quick updates it's uh it's a concept and it's the dna and you can use it for everything for deep training for ongoing for updates for for everything and again you can't fake it if you use just you know in this kind of a content as a feature so you won't create engagement you have to go all the way you have to use the platform with the right dna that's the only way to make your uh employees your followers and not to struggle and ask for their engagement this is the dna yeah and what you were talking about we see it as two sides of the same coin right training and development and you know communications two side of the same coin you can create the best content in the world but if you're delivering it delivering it in the wrong way nobody's gonna see it so what what's the worth of it um

well and and i think with that piece because to your point tall about um these these bites again snackable components i think sometimes where you see people get a bit defensive or just kind of well so what we make everything this no there's a whole ecosystem of learning in terms of yeah you're gonna have formal more deep learning but you still need to reinforce it and augment it with some of these other components because the reality is we all know that sending somebody off to do a deep session isn't it there's more to it for them to reinforce and be able to actually carry it forward and actually change behavior and some of these other use cases i just think of the one you gave early on where i mean good grief covid hit and and government agencies or medical hospital systems we're trying to figure out how do we reach nurses or epidemiologists now to let them know we just learned this about the spread of the virus and it turns out we thought we used to do this we need everybody doing this now we don't have time to spend six weeks building a formal upskilling program that needs to be laid out in a formal coms plant we just need to get something out there now exactly exactly so within within the minute they raised their phone to us 48 hours later they they send bites tons of bytes like 50 or 60 bytes 48 hours later to thousands of of uh distributed workforce anywhere from how to take a coffee test or how to distribute food to the people who are not allowed to leave their homes so for us it was a very meaningful uh you know uh use case and that you know we didn't charge for it or anything like this but it was no it was no it's a chance to actually make a difference in it exactly like this last march last year we actually felt that like we're making a difference and we saw the real value that again from the minute they raised their phone 48 hours they sent bytes to thousands of people uh geographically distributed it was it was a meaningful moment for us

very cool very cool well you know what i have so many more things that i want to ask and dig into but like we're at an hour we will come there you go you guys can do it again and we'll we'll figure out when that is which by the way for anybody who's only listening to this you have to watch the episode to see their background because the background is fantastic by the way i mean i i know backgrounds don't necessarily make or break your content but that's a pretty cool background that you've got and it's really no no oh yeah that's not a virtual one i know you don't have the little like fuzzy foggy stuff behind you as your head who's the graffiti artist yeah i love it i love it all right well thank you both for making the time especially as you're going into your weekend thanks everybody who was able to watch uh you know and and i look forward to continuing the conversation on this but hopefully for for learning comms like whoever you are thinking differently about how you're approaching content in your organization and how can we move more at the speed of of business instead of the way we've always done it lots to unpack here and i just appreciate your time thanks for being here and i hope everyone has a great rest of the week and a wonderful wonderful weekend thank you very much it was a pleasure thank you
